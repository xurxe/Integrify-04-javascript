# JavaScript exercises

My answers to a number of JS exercises.

[exercise-google-docs.js](https://github.com/xurxe/Integrify-4-javascript) contains exercises from a Google Doc that was shared with us.

The rest correspond to the repository [JavaScript for Everyone](https://github.com/xurxe/JavaScript-for-Everyone), forked from our teacher [Asabeneh](https://github.com/Asabeneh/JavaScript-for-Everyone).
